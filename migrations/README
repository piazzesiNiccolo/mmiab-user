Generic single-database configuration.

To generate a new version run 

    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask db revision

When a new revision is created it is inserted in migrations/versions and must be modified to apply required changes.

When the migrations container starts it runs flask db upgrade, so all versions contained in migrations/versions will be applied in order.
